Wanna get all issues at the same time.

For anybody reading this years later: I finally did some work on this project again. By default it will now fetch all issues + PRs, and you can selectively disabled the parts you don't want using some new flags, eg. `--no-closed-prs`.

I actually think closed issues should have always worked, but closed PRs did not.

See the help text or README for more details.
