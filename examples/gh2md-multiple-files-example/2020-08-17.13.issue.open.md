I want to export each issue in a separated file. It's possible to do?

That's not currently feature, but it wouldn't be a huge amount of work to implement. I'll try to get to it sometime, but realistically it's going to be at least a few weeks until I sit down to look at it.

Hi there! 
I would also be really interested in this possibility. I am using github issues as get-things-done lists :-) and it would be great to be able to easily export each individual issue as a md file. 
I got the idea after reading this nice article (https://rabernat.medium.com/advising-and-collaborating-during-a-pandemic-and-sabbatical-ca9531b82b6d).
