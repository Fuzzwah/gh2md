# [\#16 PR](https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md/pull/16) `closed`: Create Markdown file even after abort

I think it would be great if you can abort the whole process after a rate limit and still create the markdown file for the stuff that has already been downloaded.

Especially if you have already downloaded a few thousand entries this is very annoying.

@C0D3D3V thanks a lot for this. Sorry it's taken ages to respond - have just been super busy elsewhere. I think this is a sensible step so I'm going to test it, merge it in and do a release. IIRC this is making an API request for each issue it fetches. It would be nice to batch up multiple issues in one call - I'll try to look into whether that's possible sometime.
