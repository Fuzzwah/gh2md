git commit only if there are changes in issues.
The Actions was [passed](https://github.com/0ut0fcontrol/gh2md/actions/runs/225121459) in my fork.
`git reset --hard` to https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md/pull/14/commits/5c6709d8cf45af07c15124cf3e08df0d27c4f2da to disable actions on `push` and remove `issues.md` from my fork.
