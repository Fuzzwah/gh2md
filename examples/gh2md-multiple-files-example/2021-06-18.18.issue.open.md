I tried using gh2md on the computer here at work (running macOS 11.1) and all I get is this:

```
nicolas@computer ~ % gh2md user/project issues.md --login user
Github password for user :

```
python --version is Python 2.7.16, python3 --version is Python 3.9.5.

Any idea of what is happening? Thanks!

@nclm hey, sorry for slow response here.

I need to look at this more but I was able to reproduce it on my account by trying to clone a private repository using password login. I'm pretty sure this is because it doesn't handle 2FA login properly right now, and so probably I get the 404 because I'm not authenticated.

Do you have 2FA on your account? If so you can pass in an access token using one of:

- The `--token` flag.
- A `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.
- An API token stored in `~/.github-token`.

There are a couple of things I'll look at here:

1. 2FA login support
2. Better error handling to make it clear what's happening

If this is a public repo or you don't have 2FA on your account then let me know.
